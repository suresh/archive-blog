<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My 3-year old just got an invite from <a href="https://twitter.com/Uber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Uber</a> to become a driver for them. So many questions! But the most important one: who sold his contact details to <a href="https://twitter.com/Uber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Uber</a>&rsquo;s marketing department? His name is not really public, nor his address.</p>â€” Dumitru Erhan (@doomie) <a href="https://twitter.com/doomie/status/1045497465128906752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
