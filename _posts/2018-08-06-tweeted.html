<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your career will out-last / out-live almost every company you end up working for. While companies fade, become less relevant, you will *need* to advance, and stay relevant. You need to consider the product-of-you.</p>â€” John Cutler (@johncutlefish) <a href="https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1026200256692637696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2018</a></blockquote>
