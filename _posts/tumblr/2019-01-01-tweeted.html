<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of the emerging paradoxes of the contemporary data revolution is that while an exponential explosion of data is being collected, our current era will be largely invisibly to historians of the future because the data are being stored in highly unstable/perishable formats</p>â€” Nils Gilman (@nils_gilman) <a href="https://twitter.com/nils_gilman/status/1079727404371726347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2018</a></blockquote>
