<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When people say that not everyone can ride a bike, remember that the alternative doesn&rsquo;t have to be driving. There are many adaptive cycles, wheelchair attachments, and options available to all kinds of people. The only required ingredient for mobility for all is safe streets. <a href="https://t.co/FFb12lvtaQ">pic.twitter.com/FFb12lvtaQ</a></p>â€” Doug Gordon (@BrooklynSpoke) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrooklynSpoke/status/1040643796747333632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2018</a></blockquote>
