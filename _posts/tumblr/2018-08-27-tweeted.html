<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investors have different incentives than founders. <br/><br/>What investors often look for in a “great” founder is irrational behavior that the investor doesn’t engage in themselves. <br/><br/>I.e., 80-hour weeks for 10 years, passing up a big acquisition to go for broke, zero diversification.</p>— Naval (@naval) <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1033856420649652224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2018</a></blockquote>
