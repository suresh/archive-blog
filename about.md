I have experience in using data to generate insights and make better decisions. I enjoy programming & tinkering  electronics. I have hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, and Sentiment Analysis. My work relies heavily on implementing efficient program algorithms, Monte Carlo modeling, and performing statistical inference. 

### Skills
Preferred machine learning (scikit, xgboost), data visualization (D3.js), big data (Spark), deep learning (Theano, Keras, TensorFlow).
* Python [pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, pyspark]
* R
* Scala, Spark [MLlib, GraphX, DataFrames]
* SQL [Hive, PostgreSQL, MySQL]
* Linux & MacOS, Git [GitHub], AWS [EMR, S3, EC2]

### Education
I have a Masters degree from University of Connecticut in Data Science. Also an MBA from Indian School of Business, Hyderabad and Engineering degree from CEG, Chennai. In the past, I have worked on several projects in financial services, manufacturing & retail industries. 

### Acknowledgements
I utilized my own HTML templates, but had no prior knowledge of liquid nor the required Jekyll system file format. I took [Michael Rose](http://twitter.com/mmistakes)'s theme [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help.

 The lovely font shown here is Calendas. For full splendor on your blog, I suggest you [head over and buy that](http://calendasplus.com/). The full family is 3 weights and costs $3. Many thanks to Daniel Bruce for the wonderful Entypo icons. Those can be picked up at [entypo.com](http://entypo.com), but are included with the source files. It's also <b>retina ready</b> via retina.js. Check out how that works over at [retinajs.com](http://retinajs.com).
